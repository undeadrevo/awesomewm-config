Change the rules and keybinds to your liking as I release it from my personal use to yours.

Change line 31 in /usr/share/awesome/lib/wibox/textclock.lua from 'timeout = timeout or 60' to 'timeout = timeout or 1' for a proper second ticker in the clock. If you know how to do it from the theme file, make a pull request and I will graciously add it and credit you here.
